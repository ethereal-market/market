It is ensured by a cryptographic commit/reveal process: <ul><li>Unique but random looking hash corresponding to your swap is getting committed to reserve your spot in the market execution order.</li><li>Reveals are submitted 3 - 5 blocks after commits. Reveals are price-matched and executed in the same order as commits came in. Swap confirmation time would take only 3 - 5 blocks longer than a regular Ethereum transaction (about 30 - 60 seconds longer). If someone decides not to reveal their commit, market would hold execution of that swap pair for 7 blocks before evicting such commit. This round would take 7 blocks to clear (2 minutes).</li><li>There is no maker/taker commission but there will be a fixed fee (disabled for now) to commit a swap: 1,000,000 gas paid in ETH. This is required to prevent spamming and demotivate gas price manipulation. The fee is about $0.50 to submit a slow commit and goes up as you increase your gas price.</li><li>Your tokens are kept in your wallet all the time and swapped directly into counter-party wallet when matching counter-commit appears. If tokens are not present in your wallet at such moment, your commit gets evicted.</li></ul></p></div><div class="col-lg"><hr class="my-4"><p class="lead">Full decentralization: <ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://blockstack.org/technology">Blockstack authentication and storage</a> for user accounts and private data.</li><li>Secure IPFS site hosting with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/distributed-web-gateway/">Cloudflare distributed web gateway</a>.</li><li>All market functionality is implemented in an autonomous smart-contract on Ethereum blockchain.
